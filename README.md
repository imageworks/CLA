# Sony Pictures Imageworks Contrbutor License Agreements

These are the contributor license agreements (CLAs) for open source projects
sponsored by Sony Pictures Imageworks.

* [Corporate CLA](SPI_CLA_Corporate.pdf)
  - If you work for a company that might own IP you produce. (Note: for
    full-time employees of US tech or entertainment companies, this is
    typically the case, even if you wrote the code on your own time and using
    your own equipment.)
* [Individual CLA](SPI_CLA_Individual.pdf)
  - If you are sure you are contributing code that you fully own.

You can ignore the instructions in the CLAs about how to "fax" the signed copy
or mail it to a physical address. It is sufficient email a scan or image of
the signed document to opensource@imageworks.com
